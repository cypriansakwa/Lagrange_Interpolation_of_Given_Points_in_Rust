## Overview 
This Rust program implements the Lagrange interpolation method to estimate the value of a function at a specific point, given a set of known points.
## Features
- **Lagrange Interpolation:** Interpolates a value for a given $x$ based on a set of points.
- **Flexible Input:** You can modify the points and the target $x$ value to compute the interpolated result for different cases.
- **Simple and Efficient:** Implements the Lagrange formula in a straightforward and efficient manner using Rust.
